if you want to  open the link in next tab  in html-> <a href="https//:avbkjx/" target="_blank"></a>
if you want to give extra details to html tags, use attributes(name = "value") -> <ol> <ul type = "A"></ul></ol>
if you want to go from next tab to previous tab using links -> <a href="../index.html">Home</a>,here previous tab is index.html 
i.e it is the parent

internal links in html : 
if you want back to top -> <a href = "#">back to top</a>
if you want top to back in a page -> <a href="#comments">go to comments</a> becoz in comments section te div id is comments

block elemnts:
    <h></h>,<p></p>,<div></div> are all block elemnts
    <img> <a href> are all inline elemnets
        
        
forms:
input id is to be given in the lable for ="" and required is used that it cannot skip
palceholder is used to give the example of how it is to be in the format.
name is used in the input tag,becoz it is more important to retieve the value which user enters.

<lable for="user">username</lable>
<input type="text" id ="user" name = username required placeholder="abc@xxx.com" disabled >


radio buttons and checkbox are having both name and value becoz the user just select the options, if we need 
to retrive the value ,we are giving the value of options.
* we are giving the same name to all becoz the user slects only one options.

<input type ="radio" name = "gender" value="female">
<input type ="radio" name = "gender" value="male">
<input type ="radio" name = "gender" value="other">

To have many options we go with select and options 
<select name="month-selected">
    <options>Jan</options>
    <options>Feb</options>
</select>
<textarea></textarea>
<button></button>

Form attributes:
<form action ="" method = " get/post">
</form>

get is used get some information from the server without any change in database but we can see the values of the user
in the url ,so it is not secure

post method is used to send the values to the server to process it.


Media tags:
it can be for multiple media resource
<audio controls>
    <source src="static/audio.mp3" type="audio.mp3">
    <source src="static/audio.mp3" type="audio.mp3">
    <source src="static/audio.mp3" type="audio.mp3">
</audio>
<video controls>
    <source src="static/video.mp4" type="video.mp3">
</video>
<figure>

</figure>


CSS:

rem vs em : rem goes with its font size of root such as html,body but em goes with its parent div

html{
    font-size :20px;
}
then rem adjusts according to above for fonts. 

if you want to adjusts the box size then use em  for bigger or smaller to its parent div.

Margins:

Vertical margins of 2 divs or 2 boxes such as div 1 as margin-bottom 10px and div2 as margin-top 20px collapse it wont give
add 30px space between 2divs. only horizontal divs adds space according to its margin given.

margins can have negative values.

Padding:
It doesnt have negative values.

Span comes in the same line. 

Display:
since divs are always block elements, inorder to make 2 divs adjacent to each other we use display:inline-block . 
and some gap is present so we set margins to negative.

<Aside></Aside>:
It is used for making context to one end.

display : inline-block
width :20%
vertical-align :top (it goes to top corner)

Position :
Absolute , left : It makes the left adjustment to its parent, no space is reserved and parent div should specify it as relative.
Relative ,left : It makes adjustment to its own position and takes its full space 

Box-Sizing:
Border-box : It doesnt include the border and padding for width and height
Content-box : It includes both border and padding for width and height 

Overflow:
scroll/auto : if content is too big than the div then it is said to scroll or auto

Flex: It gives flexibiliy to arrange the items together.

display : flex;
flex-direction : row 
flex-wrap : wrap 
justify-content : space-around
<align-items:center

wrap makes the elements to use multiple lines in the container.

Flex grow : It takes the remaining space  of the container  to grow 
    so whole container - occupied container  = remaining space 

Flex shrink : if there is no space then it shrinks.
